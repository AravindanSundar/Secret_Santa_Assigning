# Secret Santa Assignment Project

This project is for generating a csv output. The output will contain a randomized assignment of Secret Santas to each employee.

## Input Parameters
The input files must be in csv format. The files must be named 'Employee-List.csv' and 'Secret-Santa-Game-Result-2023.csv'

## Output Parameters
The output file will be in csv format. The output file will be named 'Secret-Santa-Game-Result-2024.csv'

## What packages must be installed
For the output to be generated, we need to install only the pandas package. Once that package is installed, we can run the code and it will generate the required output!
